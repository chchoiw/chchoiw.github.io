## HDF5


1.  install szip libcurl --prefix=/usr/local

```bash
./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/x64/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local
 make
 make check
 make install
```








2. for wrf em , we need --enable-fortran to have -lhdf5_fortran

```bash
./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/x64/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local --enable-fortran
 make> &make.txt &
 tail -f make.txt
 make check
 make install
```








2.a. compile with FC=mpif90 CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++

```bash
./configure FC=mpif90 CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ --prefix=/home/chchoi/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local CFLAGS="-O -DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran" CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran" CPPFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran"
```







3. vi ~/.bashrc for HDF5 Path

```bash
export HDF5=/home/chchoi/hdf5
export PATH=$PATH:$HDF5/bin
```


don't mv lib64 lib for hdf5 beacuse netcdf-4 cannot be compiled

## Netcdf-4


#### Method 1.


> Setting **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** and **C_INCLUDE_PATH** for the sake of finding hdf5.h when configure netcdf-4 with option --enable-netcdf-4.

>Then we can also set **CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran** which is <span style="color:red">very important</span> to install laps and wrf with pgi

If you have already revised .bashrc and resource ~/.bashrc as following:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$HDF5/lib64
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:$HDF5/include
```

```bash
 ./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/netcdf4 --with-hdf5=/home/chchoi/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local --enable-netcdf-4
 make> &make.txt &
 tail -f make.txt
 make check (this would be an error in ncgen with SMG Linux Machine)
 make install
```



#### Method 2.


Setting equality when configuring netcdf-4


```bash
CPPFLAGS=-I$HDF5/include,-DpgiFortran
LDLAGS=-L$HDF5/lib
```

Hence, the whole configure include LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS is 

```bash
./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-I/home/chchoi/x64/hdf5/include,-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/x64/netcdf4 --with-hdf5=/home/chchoi/x64/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --enable-netcdf-4 LDFLAGS=-L/home/chchoi/x64/hdf5/lib
```








> compile with mpif90 mpicc mpic++

```bash
 ./configure --prefix=/home/chchoi/netcdf4 --with-hdf5=/home/chchoi/hdf5 --with-zlib=/usr/local --with-szlib=/usr/local --enable-netcdf-4 CFLAGS="-O -DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran" CXXFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran" CPPFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -DpgiFortran" CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ FC=mpif90 LDFLAGS=-L/home/chchoi/hdf5/lib64
```







**<span style="color:red;">Errors for Netcdf-4-C</span>**

```bash
error "occurlfunctions.c:167: error: 'CURLOPT_USE_SSL' undeclared (first use in this function) "
```


How to correct it  : 
```bash
add flags   --disable-dap
```

## Netcdf4-fortran








1. vi ~/.bashrc for netcdf-4-C path

    ```bash
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/home/chchoi/netcdf4/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/chchoi/netcdf4/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

    This sets the C include library in order to find netcdf.h when configuring netcdf-fortran-4.
    Moreover,we can also set **CPPFLAGS=-DpgiFortran** which is very important to install laps

    Next step is configuring it with the following options:

    ```bash
    ./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPLAGS=-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/netcdf4
    make
    make check
    make install
    ```








2. On the other hand, if you do not set .bashrc about C_INCLUDE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then using the following commands:

    ```bash
    ./configure FC=pgf90 CC=gcc CPPLAGS=-I/home/chchoi/x64/netcdf4/include,-DpgiFortran FFLAGS=-O --prefix=/home/chchoi/x64/netcdf4 LDFLAGS=-L/home/chchoi/x64/netcdf4/lib
    make
    make check
    make install
    ```


    > Remark: LDFLAGS=-L/home/chchoi/netcdf4/lib64 , after compile netcdf-fortran, change lib64 to lib. Otherwise, wrf-em cannot recognize where netcdf lib locate









3. **<span style="color:red">Errors:</span>**



    checking netcdf path is the location of netcdf4, not netcdf3, also export to see C_INCLUDE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH to NOT include netcdf3 path.

    If there are path set in C_INCLUDE_PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, please empty them and source ~/.bashrc again

    cannot compute sizeof (off_t).

    how to correct it : delete LDFLAGS when configuration



4. After complete netcdf4


   - rename lib
  

   ```bash
   mv $NETCDF/lib64 to $NETCDF/lib
   ```

   and it is very important to compile wrf-em







   - vi .bashrc for NETCDF PATH

   ```bash
    export NETCDF=/home/chchoi/netcdf4
    export PATH=$NETCDF/bin:$PATH
    export NETCDF_LIB=$NETCDF/lib
    export NETCDF_INC=$NETCDF/include
   ```







   - How to use netcdf


        i.  nc to cdl :#
        ```bash
        cdump netcdf.ncf > netcdf.cdl
        ```

        ii.  cdl to nc :
        ```bash
        ncgen -f netcdf.cdl > netcdf.f
        ```
