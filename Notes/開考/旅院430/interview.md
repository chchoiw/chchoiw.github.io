## Why there is a Gap between 06/2010 and 09/2013
Basically, I went to work and accumulated finical backup. Applied master degree would be the next step. 



## 自我介紹  

Hello, my name is Choi Chong Ha, I graduated from National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan in Mathematics after Bachelor, and then receive my mphil degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Mathematics.

In terms of work experience, I previously worked as a clerk at the Macau University of Science and Technology's business school, where I provided administrative support and assisted event organization. I currently work with Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau, where my primary responsibilities include data analysis and data visualization. For instance, I am able to select data from database by using sql and develop a website with dynamic and interactive statistical diagrams for data visualization, and using Python for data analysis, I made a typhoon track probability map.    

## 興趣  
    
I enjoy reading; for instance, I recently finished reading volumes 1 and 2 of "The Three-Body Problem,". Despite i studied math. science fiction is not my preferred novel style. I would rather read novels describing people emotions. "Love in the Time of Cholera" is another choise. 



## 不是數據分析師，為什麽要考  
I have data analysis experience in my current job and I found that data analysis with statistics or further machine learning would match my primary study. Furthermore, the way to find and conclude the basic principle behind data would interest me and give me a sense of achievement.  
  
## 離職原因是什麽  

Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau focuses mainly on weather observation, and I found that data analysis with statistics or further machine learning would match my primary study. In addition, I find that joining a professional team helps me to improve my data analysis abilities.
  

  
## 怎樣才是一名合格的數據分析師  
Being a qualified data analysis is a long-term process . There are a lot of traits would be required. First, find the valued questions that draw public attention and help decision-making for government. Second, applying academic methods to achieve the purposes required comprehensive abilities. When outcomes of analyzing data do curnot fit the expectation, finding the reasons and modifying the methods are vital. Finally, displaying results with concise articles and interactive and dynamic diagrams would be better to delivery the messages.  

## 工作中的挑戰和應對  (成功)
My colleague contacted the vendor for the storm surge and typhoon forecast products. One day, he asked me about a math/statistical algorithm that the render used to calculate the typhoon track probabilities. I tried to explain the professional terms, such as integral and 1-sigma for 70 percent, to him. Furthermore, my colleagues discovered that the outcome differs from that of the ECMWF, an authoritative organization in numerical forecasting. I was interested in those problems and found information from the Hong Kong Observatory's YouTube channel, and I succeeded in following the algorithm introduced to generate the typhoon track probabilities map similar to ECMWF.

## 工作中的挑戰和應對  (失敗)
This job's first mission was to build up a weather numerical model and merge obserative data into models, named LAPS. Rare information can be found online. I could only read the code from the model and found the rules how to create suitable formatted data and inject into the model. However, after several months, Laps announced that it would not be updated anymore. As a result, predicted the trendcy in industry is curcial, and understanding the fundamental principles would aid in problem solving. 
 
## 最大的優勢  
I love studying and challenges. Encountering new challenges would push me to think outside the box and more creative, new ideas and methods will be found in the processing in order to tackle them.  
 
## 最大的劣勢  

I am not skill in sports. However, during the previous three years, the COVID-19 epidemic's effects made me realize how important health is. Physical fitness is the best defense, so I started jogging.

I would rather reading than speaking. I like stay alone and as a result i have less communication with others. I still recognized that the importance of team-work , therefore, i would share my difficults or outcomes in time.
 

## 您認為我們公司有哪些尚待改進的地方嗎？



## Data analysis project 



## Why do you want to work at this company?
There are three points why I want to work at IFT. 
I saw MTSI and other useful indexes on ITRC, and there are many dynamic graphs showing various comparisons, which is my  

## 有甚麽問題 
I found that MHRM is related to human resources instead of focusing on tourism. Hence, is there room to study topics other than tourism?


## Where do you see yourself in five years?
我希望在數據分析上有所發展, 我有結實的數學基礎和有寫程序的經驗, 現在還在不斷學習編程技和機器學習的理論, 相信將來會有很好的實踐

I see my long-term career in data analysis. I have a strong background in math and now working at programming. Moreover, I plan to study new programming techinques and theories of machine learning. I'm sure I'll have a successful practice in the future.



## 對我們公司有甚麽了解

[itrc](http://itrc.iftm.edu.mo/the-centre)
ITRC is the policy research and industry development unit of the Macao Institute for Tourism Studies (IFTM). The Centre serves as a management and public policy think-tank and a knowledge provider for tourism and hospitality related research. 

Our activities include conducting policy studies, monitoring and evaluation studies, research design and opinion surveys,  reporting of research findings, as well as organizing seminars.

There are four indexes posted online.
The First is Macau Tourism Carrying Capacity Study
The Second is Macau Tourist Satisfaction Index(MTSI)

The MTSI measures visitors’ satisfaction across 10 tourism related sectors. This includes hotels,  restaurants, transportation,  heritage attractions, non-heritage attractions,  retail shops, public services (e.g. customs and immigration), events,tour operators and guides, and gaming. An overall satisfaction index (or TSI) for the tourism industry in Macao is then estimated based on the sectoral results.

The third is Macau Visitor Profile Survey (VPS)

The VPS is a year-round survey that studies the the trip characteristics, purpose of visit, source of gaining travel information, travel arrangement and activity, spending behaviour, length of stay, source market, etc. of the visitors.


The forth is Macao Humoan Resource Monitor Survey (MHRM)
